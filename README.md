# paC-man
Pacman clone in C

An attempt at developing a game by complete novices at C programming, as First Year Computer Engg project.

## Instructions

### Note
>The aim of this project was to use graphics.h functions to create the game. Graphics header functions rely on the Borland Graphics Interface, a graphics library for 16-bit DOS systems. As such, most of these functions are deprecated, and the code will fail to compile using most compilers. It is only guaranteed to compile using [Turbo C++](https://turboc.codeplex.com/) and will only run on DOS emulators (e.g. DOSBox, which comes bundled with TC++).

>The aim is to update the project to support modern systems and add support for Linux in the long run, once the actual project has been evaluated.

1. Download the source code PAC.C
2. Copy the file to your Turbo C++ Projects directory or to any other known location on your storage.
3. Open Turbo C++ and open the downloaded file using File> Open (keyboard shortcut: F3) and navigating to the PAC.C file.
4. Compile and run the game using Run> Run (keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+F9)

## Contributing

The official deadline for submission of this project is in one month, so by the time you see this it will most likely be long dead. But if you have any contributions to make, whether additions or improvements, do not hesitate to create a pull request.
(I wasn't kidding when I said we are complete novices at C...so it is *very* likely our code will be absolutely unoptimized and highly inefficient)

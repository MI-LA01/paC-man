## Contributing

The deadline for submission of this project is in one month, so by the time you see this it will most likely be long dead. But if you have any contributions to make, whether additions or improvements, do not hesitate to create a pull request.
(I wasn't kidding when I said we are complete novices at C...so it is *very* likely our code will be absolutely unoptimized and highly inefficient)
